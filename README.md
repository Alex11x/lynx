Lynx is a high-fidelity video generation model for personalized video synthesis from a single input image. Built on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) foundation model with lightweight ID-adapters and Ref-adapters for identity preservation and spatial detail enhancement.


## Installation

### Dependencies
Tested on CUDA 12.4
```bash
conda create -n lynx python=3.10
conda activate lynx
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For lynx full model, flash attention is required
pip install flash_attn==2.7.4.post1 # flash attention 3 is also supported, will be faster
```

### Model Download

- Base model: Download from [Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-14B-Diffusers](https://huggingface.co/Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-14B-Diffusers), place it at `models/Wan2.1-T2V-14B-Diffusers`
- Lynx: Download `lynx_full` from [ByteDance/lynx](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance/lynx), place it at `models/lynx_full`
- Lynx-lite: Download `lynx_lite` from [ByteDance/lynx](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance/lynx), place it at `models/lynx_lite`


## Full Model

Complete version with all advanced features and best performance.

### Usage

**Run a simple single-GPU inference:**
```bash
python infer.py --subject_image demo/subjects/demo_subject.png --prompt "A person carves a pumpkin on a porch in the evening. The camera captures their upper body as they draw a face with a marker, carefully cut along the lines, then lift the lid with both hands. Their face lights up with excitement as they peek inside." --seed 42

python infer.py --subject_image demo/subjects/demo_subject.png --prompt demo/prompts/demo_prompt.txt --seed 42
```

## Lite Model

Lightweight version optimized for resource-constrained environments, with 24 fps video support.

### Usage

**Run a simple single-GPU inference:**
```bash
python infer_lite.py --subject_image demo/subjects/demo_subject.png --prompt "A person carves a pumpkin on a porch in the evening. The camera captures their upper body as they draw a face with a marker, carefully cut along the lines, then lift the lid with both hands. Their face lights up with excitement as they peek inside." --seed 42

python infer_lite.py --subject_image demo/subjects/demo_subject.png --prompt demo/prompts/demo_prompt.txt --seed 42
```
